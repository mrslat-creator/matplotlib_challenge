After analyzing and summarizing statistical data, creating the following plots: bar, pie, box, line, and scatter, and locating the 
quartiles, IQR and Outliers, I have observed the following about the drug regimens used on the mice in this study. That the more the mouse weighs has a direct effect on how big their tumor increases. The correlation between a mouse's weight and the average volume or mass of the
tumor is 0.84. Another observation is that the goal is to reduce the size of the tumor with a drug regimens, the two treatments that seem to work the best at this are Capomulin and Ramicane.
